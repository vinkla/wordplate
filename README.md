## Install Composer
WordPlate utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. So, before using WordPlate, you will need to make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.

## Install WordPlate
First, download the WordPlate installer using Composer.

```bash
composer global require wordplate/installer
```

Make sure to place the `~/.composer/vendor/bin` directory in your PATH so the `wordplate` executable can be located by your system.

Once installed, the new simple WordPlate command will create a fresh WordPlate installation in the directory you specify. For instance, `wordplate new acme` would create a directory named acme containing a fresh WordPlate installation with all dependencies installed. This method of installation is much faster than installing via Composer:

```bash
wordplate new acme
```

### Via Composer Create-Project
You may also install WordPlate by issuing the Composer create-project command in your terminal:

```bash
composer create-project wordplate/wordplate acme
```

## Environment

Add the database credentials and [salts](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt) to the `.env` configuration environment file.

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=wordpress
DB_USER=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

## Install WordPress

Open up your browser and visit the project URL with `/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php` to install WordPress.

Thats it. We're done. Lets build stuff!

> Please note that if you aren't running your installation from the root you'll have to update [WP_CONTENT_URL](wp-config.php) in `wp-config.php`.

## Theming
Library configuration can be edited in the `wp-content/themes/wordplate/config` directory. Visit [wp-custom-post-type-class](https://github.com/jjgrainger/wp-custom-post-type-class) to read about adding custom post types. Custom post types can be added within the `wp-content/themes/wordplate/includes/post-types` directory.

The boilerplate doesn't include a way to create custom fields. Instead use [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). It is specified by default in our `composer.json` file.
