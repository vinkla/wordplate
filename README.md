# WordPlate

WordPlate is a boilerplate. It's like building any other WordPress website with themes and plugins. Just with sprinkles on top.

## Features

- **WordPress + Composer = ♥️**
    
    WordPress is installed using Composer which allows WordPress to be updated by running `composer update`.

- **Environment Files**
    
    Similar to Laravel, WordPlate puts environment variables within an `.env` file such as database credentials.

- **WordPress Packagist**
    
    With WordPress Packagist you may manage your WordPress plugins and themes with Composer.

- **Must-use plugins**
    
    Don't worry about client deactivating plugins, [must-use plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/must-use-plugins/) is enabled by default.

- **Vite.js**
    
    With Vite you can quickly get up and running to build and minify your CSS and JavaScript.

- **Debugging**
    
    Familiar debugging helper functions are integrated such as `dump()` and `dd()`.

- **Clean UI**

    WordPlate takes control over the WordPress dashboard and provides a [better UX](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/499192/143415951-b01e9498-5f18-44dd-9d4b-51fb2d479a22.png) for your clients.

- **Security**
    
    With the [`roots/wp-password-bcrypt`](https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt#readme) package we've replaced WordPress outdated and insecure MD5-based password hashing with the modern and secure bcrypt.

## Installation

To use WordPlate, you need to have at least PHP 8.1 and MySQL 8.0 installed on your machine. 

WordPlate utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. So, before using WordPlate, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.

Install WordPlate by issuing the Composer `create-project` command in your terminal:

```sh
composer create-project --prefer-dist vinkla/wordplate blog
```

Update the database credentials in the `.env` file:

```
DB_NAME=database
DB_USER=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

Serve your application using the [built-in web server in PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) (or your server of choice) from the `public` directory:

```sh
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public/
```

Visit your application in the browser:

- [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) - Your website.
- [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/wordpress/wp-admin`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/wordpress/wp-admin) - The administration dashboard.

## Configuration

### Public Directory

After installing WordPlate, you should configure your web server's document / web root to be the `public` directory. The `index.php` in this directory serves as the front controller for all HTTP requests entering your application.

### Salt Keys

The next thing you should do after installing WordPlate is adding salt keys to your environment file.

Typically, these strings should be 64 characters long. The keys can be set in the `.env` environment file. If you have not copied the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`, you should do that now. **If the salt keys isn't set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure.**

If you're lazy like us, [visit our salt key generator](https://vinkla.github.io/salts/) and copy the randomly generated keys to your `.env` file.

### Environment Configuration

It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on the environment where the application is running. For example, you may wish to use a different database locally than you do on your production server.

To make this a cinch, WordPlate utilizes the [`vlucas/phpdotenv`](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) PHP package. In a fresh WordPlate installation, the root directory of your application will contain a `.env.example` file. If you install WordPlate via Composer, this file will automatically be renamed to `.env`. Otherwise, you should rename the file manually.

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer / server using your application could require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.

Read more about environment variables in Laravel's documentation:

- [Environment Variable Types](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/configuration#environment-variable-types)
- [Retrieving Environment Configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/configuration#retrieving-environment-configuration)

## Plugins

### WordPress Packagist

We've integrated [WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org) which makes it possible to install plugins with Composer. WordPress Packagist mirrors the WordPress plugin and theme directories as a Composer repository.

Install the desired plugins using `wpackagist-plugin` as the vendor name. Packages are installed in the `public/plugins` directory.

```bash
composer require wpackagist-plugin/clean-image-filenames
```

This is an example of how your `composer.json` file might look like:

```json
"require": {
    "wpackagist-plugin/clean-image-filenames": "^1.3"
}
```

[Please visit WordPress Packagist for more information and examples.](https://wpackagist.org)

### Must Use Plugins

[Must-use plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/must-use-plugins/) (a.k.a. mu-plugins) are plugins installed in a special directory inside the content folder and which are automatically enabled on all sites in the installation.

To install plugins into into the `mu-plugins` directory, add the plugin name to the `installer-paths` in your `composer.json` file:

```json
"installer-paths": {
    "public/mu-plugins/{$name}": [
        "type:wordpress-muplugin",
        "wpackagist-plugin/clean-image-filenames",
    ]
}
```

Install the plugin using `wpackagist-plugin` as the vendor name.

```sh
composer require wpackagist-plugin/clean-image-filenames
```

The plugin should now be installed in the `public/mu-plugins` directory.

[Read more about the must-use plugin autoloader in the documentation.](https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/mu-plugin-autoloader/)

### Included Plugins

#### [Headache](https://github.com/vinkla/headache)

An easy-to-swallow painkiller plugin for WordPress. It is included by default in WordPlate. It removes a lot of default WordPress stuff you just can't wait to get rid of. It removes meta tags such as feeds, version numbers and emojis.

#### [Clean Image Filenames](https://wordpress.org/plugins/clean-image-filenames/)

The plugin automatically converts language accent characters in filenames when uploading to the media library. Characters are converted into browser and server friendly, non-accent characters.

- Räksmörgås.jpg → raksmorgas.jpg
- Æblegrød_FTW!.gif → aeblegrod-ftw.gif
- Château de Ferrières.png → chateau-de-ferrieres.png

## Vite.js

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.

```sh
# Start the dev server...
npm run dev

# Build for production...
npm run build
```

[To get started with Vite, please visit the documentation.](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

## Mail

If you want to add custom SMTP credentials, you may add the following to your `functions.php` file:

```php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;

// Register SMTP email with HTML support.
add_action('phpmailer_init', function (PHPMailer $mail) {
    $mail->isSMTP();
    $mail->SMTPAutoTLS = false;
    $mail->SMTPAuth = env('MAIL_USERNAME') && env('MAIL_PASSWORD');
    $mail->SMTPSecure = env('MAIL_ENCRYPTION', 'tls');
    $mail->Host = env('MAIL_HOST');
    $mail->Port = env('MAIL_PORT', 587);
    $mail->Username = env('MAIL_USERNAME');
    $mail->Password = env('MAIL_PASSWORD');
    return $mail;
});

add_filter('wp_mail_content_type', fn () => 'text/html');
add_filter('wp_mail_from_name', fn () => env('MAIL_FROM_NAME', 'Example'));
add_filter('wp_mail_from', fn () => env('MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS', 'hello@example.com'));
```

Then add the environment variables to your `.env` file:

```
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=
MAIL_FROM_NAME=
MAIL_HOST=
MAIL_PASSWORD=
MAIL_PORT=
MAIL_USERNAME=
```

If you're using a service such as [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) locally, you'll need to turn of encryption:

```
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I add WordPress constants to the environment file?</strong></summary>

This is possible by updating the `public/wp-config.php` file after the WordPlate application have been created.

```diff
define('WP_DISABLE_FATAL_ERROR_HANDLER', env('WP_DISABLE_FATAL_ERROR_HANDLER', false));

+define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', env('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true));
````

Then you may add the constant to the `.env` file.

```diff
WP_DEFAULT_THEME=wordplate
+WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE=true
````

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I install languages with Composer?</strong></summary>

If you want to install language packs using Composer, we recommend looking at the [WP Languages](https://wp-languages.github.io/) project.
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Can I rename the public directory?</strong></summary>

Update your `composer.json` file with your new `public` directory path and run `composer update`.
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Can I rename the WordPress directory?</strong></summary>

By default WordPlate will put the WordPress in `public/wordpress`. If you want to change this there are a couple of steps you need to go through. Let's say you want to change the default WordPress location to `public/wp`:

1. Update the `wordpress-install-dir` path in your `composer.json` file.

2. Update `wordpress` to `wp` in `wordplate/public/.gitignore`.

3. Update the last line in the `public/index.php` file to:
    
    ```php
    require __DIR__.'/wp/wp-blog-header.php';
    ```
    
4. Update the `WP_DIR` environment variable in the `.env` file to `wp`.

5. If you're using WP-CLI, update the path in the `wp-cli.yml` file to `public/wp`.

6. Remove the `public/wordpress` directory if it exist and then run `composer update`.
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Can I rename the theme directory?</strong></summary>

For most applications you may leave the theme directory as it is. If you want to rename the `wordplate` theme to something else you'll also need to update the `WP_DEFAULT_THEME` environment variable in the `.env` file.
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use WordPlate with Laravel Valet?</strong></summary>

If you're using Laravel Valet together with WordPlate, you may use our [custom valet driver](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/valet#custom-valet-drivers):

```php
<?php

namespace Valet\Drivers\Custom;

use Valet\Drivers\BasicValetDriver;

class WordPlateValetDriver extends BasicValetDriver
{
    public function serves(string $sitePath, string $siteName, string $uri): bool
    {
        return is_dir($sitePath . '/public/wordpress');
    }

    public function isStaticFile(string $sitePath, string $siteName, string $url)
    {
        $staticFilePath = $sitePath . '/public' . $url;

        if ($this->isActualFile($staticFilePath)) {
            return $staticFilePath;
        }

        return false;
    }

    public function frontControllerPath(string $sitePath, string $siteName, string $uri): ?string
    {
        return parent::frontControllerPath(
            $sitePath . '/public',
            $siteName,
            $this->forceTrailingSlash($uri)
        );
    }

    private function forceTrailingSlash(string $uri)
    {
        if (substr($uri, -1 * strlen('/wordpress/wp-admin')) === '/wordpress/wp-admin') {
            header('Location: ' . $uri . '/');
            exit;
        }

        return $uri;
    }
}
```
